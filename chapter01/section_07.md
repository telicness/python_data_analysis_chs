# 1.7. Python and Data Analysis

The main argument of this book is to develop all the concepts of data analysis by treating them in terms of Python. The Python programming language is widely used in scientific circles because of its large number of libraries that provide a complete set of tools for analysis and data manipulation.
Compared to other programming languages generally used for data analysis, such as R and MATLAB, Python not only provides a platform for processing data, but also has features that make it unique compared to other languages and specialized applications.
The development of an ever-increasing number of support libraries, the implementation of algorithms of more innovative methodologies, and the ability to interface with other programming languages (C and Fortran) all make Python unique among its kind.
Furthermore, Python is not only specialized for data analysis, but also has many other applications, such as generic programming, scripting, interfacing to databases, and more recently web development, thanks to web frameworks like Django. So it is possible to develop data analysis projects that are compatible with the web server with the possibility to integrate it on the Web.
So, for those who want to perform data analysis, Python, with all its packages, is considered the best choice for the foreseeable future.
