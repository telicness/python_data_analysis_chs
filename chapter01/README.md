[*Chapter 1 : An Introduction to Data Analysis*](./)

In this chapter, you begin to take the first steps in the world of data analysis, learning in detail about all the concepts and processes that make up this discipline. The concepts discussed in this chapter are helpful background for the following chapters, where these concepts and procedures will be applied in the form of Python code, through the use of several libraries that will be discussed in just as many chapters.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

* [1.1. Data Analysis](section_01.md)
* [1.2. Knowledge Domains of the Data Analyst](section_02.md)
* [1.3. Understanding the Nature of the Data](section_03.md)
* [1.4. The Data Analysis Process](section_04.md)
* [1.5. Quantitative and Qualitative Data Analysis](section_05.md)
* [1.6. Open Data](section_06.md)
* [1.7. Python and Data Analysis](section_07.md)
* [1.8. Conclusions](section_08.md)
