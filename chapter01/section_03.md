# 1.3. Understanding the Nature of the Data

The object of study of data analysis is basically the data. The data then will be the key player in all processes of data analysis. The data constitute the raw material to be
processed, and thanks to their processing and analysis, it is possible to extract a variety of information in order to increase the level of knowledge of the system under study, that is, one from which the data came.


## When the Data Become Information

Data are the events recorded in the world. Anything that can be measured or categorized can be converted into data. Once collected, these data can be studied and analyzed, both to understand the nature of the events and very often also to make predictions or at least to make informed decisions.

## When the Information Becomes Knowledge  

You can speak of knowledge when the information is converted into a set of rules that helps you better understand certain mechanisms and therefore make predictions on the evolution of some events.

## Types of Data

Data can be divided into two distinct categories:
* Categorical (nominal and ordinal)
* Numerical (discrete and continuous)
Categorical data are values or observations that can be divided into groups or categories. There are two types of categorical values: nominal and ordinal. A nominal variable has no intrinsic order that is identified in its category. An ordinal variable instead has a predetermined order.
Numerical data are values or observations that come from measurements. There are two types of numerical values: discrete and continuous numbers. Discrete values can be counted and are distinct and separated from each other. Continuous values, on the other hand, are values produced by measurements or observations that assume any value within a defined range.
