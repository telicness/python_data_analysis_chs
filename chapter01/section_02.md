# 1.2. Knowledge Domains of the Data Analyst

Data analysis is basically a discipline suitable to the study of problems that may occur in several fields of applications. Moreover, data analysis includes many tools and methodologies that require good knowledge of computing, mathematical, and statistical concepts.
A good data analyst must be able to move and act in many different disciplinary areas. Many of these disciplines are the basis of the methods of data analysis, and proficiency in them is almost necessary. Knowledge of other disciplines is necessary depending on the area of application and study of the particular data analysis project you are about to undertake, and, more generally, sufficient experience in these areas can help you better understand the issues and the type of data needed.
Often, regarding major problems of data analysis, it is necessary to have an interdisciplinary team of experts who can contribute in the best possible way in their respective fields of competence. Regarding smaller problems, a good analyst must be able to recognize problems that arise during data analysis, inquire to determine which disciplines and skills are necessary to solve these problems, study these disciplines, and maybe even ask the most knowledgeable people in the sector. In short, the analyst must be able to know how to search not only for data, but also for information on how to treat that data.


## Computer Science

Knowledge of computer science is a basic requirement for any data analyst. In fact, only when you have good knowledge of and experience in computer science can you efficiently manage the necessary tools for data analysis. In fact, every step concerning data analysis involves using calculation software (such as IDL, MATLAB, etc.) and programming languages (such as C ++, Java, and Python).
The large amount of data available today, thanks to information technology, requires specific skills in order to be managed as efficiently as possible. Indeed, data research and extraction require knowledge of these various formats. The data are structured and stored in files or database tables with particular formats. XML, JSON, or simply XLS
or CSV files, are now the common formats for storing and collecting data, and many applications allow you to read and manage the data stored on them. When it comes to extracting data contained in a database, things are not so immediate, but you need to know the SQL query language or use software specially developed for the extraction of data from a given database.
Moreover, for some specific types of data research, the data are not available in an explicit format, but are present in text files (documents and log files) or web pages, and shown as charts, measures, number of visitors, or HTML tables. This requires specific technical expertise for the parsing and the eventual extraction of these data (called web scraping).
So, knowledge of information technology is necessary to know how to use the various tools made available by contemporary computer science, such as applications and programming languages. These tools, in turn, are needed to perform data analysis and data visualization.
The purpose of this book is to provide all the necessary knowledge, as far as possible, regarding the development of methodologies for data analysis. The book uses the Python programming language and specialized libraries that provide a decisive contribution to the performance of all the steps constituting data analysis, from data research to data mining, to publishing the results of the predictive model.


## Mathematics and Statistics

As you will see throughout the book, data analysis requires a lot of complex math during the treatment and processing of data. You need to be competent in all of this, at least to understand what you are doing. Some familiarity with the main statistical
concepts is also necessary because all the methods that are applied in the analysis and interpretation of data are based on these concepts. Just as you can say that computer science gives you the tools for data analysis, so you can say that the statistics provide the concepts that form the basis of data analysis.
This discipline provides many tools to the analyst, and a good knowledge of how to best use them requires years of experience. Among the most commonly used statistical techniques in data analysis are
* Bayesian methods
* Regression
* Clustering
Having to deal with these cases, you’ll discover how mathematics and statistics are closely related. Thanks to the special Python libraries covered in this book, you will be able to manage and handle them.

## Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

One of the most advanced tools that falls in the data analysis camp is machine learning. In fact, despite the data visualization and techniques such as clustering and regression, which should help you find information about the dataset, during this phase of research, you may often prefer to use special procedures that are highly specialized in searching patterns within the dataset.
Machine learning is a discipline that uses a whole series of procedures and algorithms that analyze the data in order to recognize patterns, clusters, or trends and then extracts useful information for data analysis in an automated way.
This discipline is increasingly becoming a fundamental tool of data analysis, and thus knowledge of it, at least in general, is of fundamental importance to the data analyst.


## Professional Fields of Application

Another very important point is the domain of competence of the data
(its source—biology, physics, finance, materials testing, statistics on population, etc.). In fact, although analysts have had specialized preparation in the field of statistics, they must also be able to document the source of the data, with the aim of perceiving and better understanding the mechanisms that generated the data. In fact, the data are not simple strings or numbers; they are the expression, or rather the measure, of any
parameter observed. Thus, better understanding where the data came from can improve their interpretation. Often, however, this is too costly for data analysts, even ones with the best intentions, and so it is good practice to find consultants or key figures to whom you can pose the right questions.
