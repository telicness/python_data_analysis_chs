# 1.1. 数据分析

In a world increasingly centralized around information technology, huge amounts of data are produced and stored each day. Often these data come from automatic detection systems, sensors, and scientific instrumentation, or you produce them daily and unconsciously every time you make a withdrawal from the bank or make a purchase, when you record various blogs, or even when you post on social networks.
在一个日益以信息技术为中心的世界里，每天都会产生和存储大量的数据。这些数据通常来自自动检测系统、传感器和科学仪器，或者每次你从银行提款或购买、记录各种博客或甚至在社交网络上发帖时，你都会不自觉地每天产生这些数据。
But what are the data? The data actually are not information, at least in terms of their form. In the formless stream of bytes, at first glance it is difficult to understand their essence if not strictly the number, word, or time that they report. Information is actually the result of processing, which, taking into account a certain dataset, extracts some conclusions that can be used in various ways. This process of extracting information from raw data is called data analysis.
但是数据是什么呢? 这些数据实际上不是信息，至少就它们的形式而言是这样。在无格式的字节流中，乍一看，如果不严格地理解它们所报告的数字、单词或时间，就很难理解它们的本质。信息实际上是处理的结果，在考虑到某一数据集的情况下，它提取了一些可以各种方式使用的结论。从原始数据中提取信息的过程称为数据分析。
The purpose of data analysis is to extract information that is not easily deducible but that, when understood, leads to the possibility of carrying out studies on the mechanisms of the systems that have produced them, thus allowing you to forecast possible responses of these systems and their evolution in time.  
数据分析的目的是提取不易推断的信息，但一旦被理解，就有可能对产生这些信息的系统的机制进行研究，从而使你能够预测这些系统的可能反应及其时间演变。
Starting from a simple methodical approach on data protection, data analysis has become a real discipline, leading to the development of real methodologies generating models. The model is in fact the translation into a mathematical form of a system placed under study. Once there is a mathematical or logical form that can describe system responses under different levels of precision, you can then make predictions about its development or response to certain inputs. Thus the aim of data analysis is not the model, but the quality of its predictive power.
从一种简单的数据保护方法出发，数据分析已经成为一门真正的学科，导致了真正的方法生成模型的发展。这个模型实际上是被研究的系统的数学形式的转换。一旦有一种数学或逻辑形式可以描述不同精度下的系统响应，那么您就可以预测它的发展或对某些输入的响应。因此，数据分析的目的不是模型，而是其预测能力的质量。
The predictive power of a model depends not only on the quality of the modeling techniques but also on the ability to choose a good dataset upon which to build the entire data analysis process. So the search for data, their extraction, and their subsequent preparation, while representing preliminary activities of an analysis, also belong to data analysis itself, because of their importance in the success of the results.
模型的预测能力不仅取决于建模技术的质量，还取决于选择一个良好的数据集来构建整个数据分析过程的能力。因此，对数据的搜索、提取及其后续的准备，虽然代表了一种分析的初步活动，但也属于数据分析本身，因为它们对结果的成功具有重要意义。
So far we have spoken of data, their handling, and their processing through calculation procedures. In parallel to all stages of processing of data analysis, various methods of data visualization have been developed. In fact, to understand the data, both individually and in terms of the role they play in the entire dataset, there is no better system than to develop the techniques of graphic representation capable of transforming information, sometimes implicitly hidden, in figures, which help you more easily understand their meaning. Over the years lots of display modes have been developed for different modes of data display: the charts.  
到目前为止，我们已经谈到数据，它们的处理，以及它们的处理通过计算程序。在处理数据分析的各个阶段的同时，开发了各种数据可视化方法。事实上，要理解数据，无论是单独的，还是在整个数据集中所扮演的角色，没有什么比开发图形表示技术更好的了，它能够转换图形中的信息，有时隐藏在图形中，帮助您更容易地理解它们的含义。多年来，针对不同的数据显示模式-图表，开发了大量的显示模式。
At the end of the data analysis process, you will have a model and a set of graphical displays and then you will be able to predict the responses of the system under study; after that, you will move to the test phase. The model will be tested using another set of data for which you know the system response. These data are, however, not used to define the predictive model. Depending on the ability of the model to replicate real observed responses, you will have an error calculation and knowledge of the validity of the model and its operating limits.
在数据分析过程结束时，您将有一个模型和一组图形显示，然后您将能够预测正在研究的系统的响应；之后，您将进入测试阶段。该模型将使用您知道系统响应的另一组数据进行测试。然而，这些数据并不用于定义预测模型。根据模型复制真实观察到的响应的能力，您将有一个错误计算和对模型的有效性及其操作限制的知识。
These results can be compared with any other models to understand if the newly created one is more efficient than the existing ones. Once you have assessed that, you can move to the last phase of data analysis—deployment. This consists of implementing the results produced by the analysis, namely, implementing the decisions to be taken based on the predictions generated by the model and the associated risks.
这些结果可以与任何其他模型进行比较，以了解新创建的模型是否比现有的模型更有效。评估之后，您就可以进入数据分析的最后一个阶段——部署。这包括实现分析产生的结果，也就是说，实现基于模型生成的预测和相关风险的决策。
Data analysis is well suited to many professional activities. So, knowledge of it and how it can be put into practice is relevant. It allows you to test hypotheses and to understand more deeply the systems analyzed.
数据分析非常适合于许多专业活动。因此，对它的了解以及如何将其付诸实践是非常重要的。它允许您测试假设，并更深入地理解所分析的系统。
